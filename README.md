# Jabber AI - AI project planning assistant with automated notes board
Meet your personal assistant Mindy, who is integrated into Jabber AI to help you brainstorm ideas about your next revolutionary project. Mindy helps you talk through your ideas, generate new possibilities, and encourage you when you are stuck. As you speak, GPT-4o processes your spoken ideas into digestible note cards, and displays them in a bento-box layout in your workspace. The workspace is interactive: you can delete note cards and start or stop conversations with Mindy while keeping your workspace untouched. Using Hume's Speech Prosody model, Jabber AI analyzes expressions in the user's voice and emphasizes notes on the screen that the user is excited about.
